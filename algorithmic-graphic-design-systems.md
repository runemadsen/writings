On Algorithmic Design Systems
==============================

> Meta-design is much more difficult than design; it’s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. - Donald Knuth, The Metafont Book

This is the first of hopefully many posts describing something I see as a continuing trend in the graphic design world: The rise of the meta-designer, and the use of algorithmic design systems.

Until recently, the term *Graphic Designer* was used to describe artists with their roots firmly planted in the fine arts. Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and a curriculum based on traditions from painting, sculpture and architecture: The concepts of form, color and composition were introduced through manual exercises, like the paper-based color experiments from Josef Alber's incredible *The Interaction of Color*. At best, this teaches the designer about intuition and not being dictated by their given tool. At worst, the designer is institutionalized to think of themselves as an ideator, as a direct opposite to a technical person. Paul Rand famously said: *It's important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator*. This echoes much of what I was taught early in my career.












This changed with the computer.....

I think we're seeing a third evolution of the graphic designer....






This changed over the last 10 or so years, with web design.

However, a second wave of influence in design. Much broader and significant.







Aspiring designers


 graduate with MFA degrees from campuses all over



However, this is changing. 



The first obvious step away from the manual workflows came with the advent of computers at academic institutions in the 1960's and 1970's, and has cumulated with Silicon Valley, the internet, and what we today call a web designer: Someone who needs to understand a system and logic. This is well documented, and has already happened. I'm talking about something much bigger than the design of websites.

WHAT IS IT.

REASONS TO THIS: FACTORS.

design as a system. The product as as system.

When you look at the design products....

## WHAT IS IT!
I'm not just talking about websites, although it's a part of it.
WHAT ARE THE FACTORS.
The definition of a designer is changing.
The demands of design products are changing.

- A new generation with code as a tool. Grew up on the internet.
- increasing demand for dynamic design products. As our world goes digital, products are no longer static. Deliverables are websites, software systems, and even software to generate static printable files. The merigng of code and design. It has states and motion.

- History of systems in design. (there's a bunch of this). !!!!
- Data as content. The only way to design it is to code it. Systems are the way to do that.

Third, a number of new programming environments now provide an excellent level of entry for many people who wouldn't ordinarily think of themselves as programmers.

There are several factors that led me to this conclusion. First of all, I believe that rules and systems have always been a key part of even the most visionary art practices, and many designers are finally realizing this. Second, the computer has a continuing influence on the graphic design world, and we are seeing a new generation of designers who 

During the last 3 years, I've taught a graduate class at the Interactive Telecommunications at New York University called *Printing Code*. In this course my students explore the fundamentals of graphic design through code. Subjects like form, composition, colors systems, grid systems and typefaces are all taught through the use of code, and every week students write a software program that generates a PDF file, and bring to class a print of this output.

Although the internet (and web design in particular) has clear parallels to what I'm describing, it's not specifically what I have in mind when I say *Algorithmic Graphic Design Systems*.



Systems in our Design History
-----------------------------

It's no secret that the history of graphic design is full of functionalists, who wanted to distill the elements of graphic design into a fixed number of rules or methods.

The artistic movements in the early 20th century (most notably the Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl) all introduced a very strong reinvention of graphic form. Even though 


as many of them rejected the former divide between high art and every day design. As shown in the image below, this futurist newspaper design explores the use limits of typography and composition, but it all happens within a very strict grid system dictacted by the printing press.

This display of creativity within constraints can especially be found in the De Stijl movement, which was an abstract art movement formed in the Netherlands. With its strict minimalism, De Stijl artists kept to a bare minimum of expression, rarely using anything other than straight lines and primary colors. As a very pure definition of a set of design rules, this approach was used not only in painting or furniture design, but also in everyday print products.

The important thing to notice in the example above – a logo for the De Stijl movement – is the almost algorithmic use of form and proportion. It points towards the later works of Sol Lewitt, the early experiments in computational art, and even the recent work of design companies like Sagmeister and Walsh.

The Bauhaus school in Germany, with its motto *Form Follows Function*, is a perfect example of rules applied to the field of graphic design. This was where Joannes Itten and Josef Albers both tried to define a taxonomy of color systems, where Paul Klee held his famous lectures on form and design theory, and where Jan Tschichold was inspired to write his modernist manifesto on typography, *Die Neue Typografie*. 

The *Swiss Design* style is arguably the clearest example of rules and systems applied to graphic design. Primarily centered around two books, Josef Müller-Brockmann’s *Grid Systems in Graphic Design* and Karl Gerstner’s *Designing Programmes*, it distilled graphic design into a series of simple rules. Use Helvetica. Use a grid system. It was a return to a the purely functional graphic art.

Explain divide....

For someone who grew up as a part of the computer generation, this divide might seem problematic. My first experiments with color and form was also when learning HTML and CSS, so how do I know where design stops and programming begins? Graphic design and programming are so intermingled today that a term like Computational Design seems like a much better explanation of the two merging fields. Design is how it works, not just a last layer of make-up.

As I’ve grown more experienced as a graphic designer, it has become obvious that a great deal of this experience is built on a very systematic approach to design. Graphic design can at times seem like algorithms controlled by a creative vision. Grids are just basic measurements. Typography is spacing and curves. Color schemes are proportional spacings placed on the color spectrum. This class is about investigating what happens when we start creating graphic art only by writing code. It’s an experiment in replacing already exiting tools (that too long has dictated the visual look of computational design - hello drop shadow) with our own software programs. We will investigate graphic design systems, distill them into algorithms, and eventually let them spin out of control.

It’s important to note that this class is not so much about generative design, as it’s about graphic design through code. I see no value in splattering a shape 5000 times on a canvas, calling it generative art, just because we can. It’s about distilling already existing graphic design techniques into code, making valid and reasonable assumptions, and then - only then - letting things spin out of control.



Through teaching this class, I'm convinced that rules in learning is the most important.
